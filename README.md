# GitOps Example with Dockerized Application

This project demonstrates a GitOps workflow using Docker and GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment of a web application.

## Description

The application is designed to showcase GitOps principles, where changes pushed to the `main` branch trigger an automated process that rebuilds and updates the Docker image on Docker Hub. This enables seamless delivery of updates without manual intervention.

## Technologies Used

- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- Docker Hub
- Any web application framework or stack (replace with your specific tech stack)

## Prerequisites

To replicate or use this project, you need:

- Docker installed on your local machine. Download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- A Docker Hub account for storing your images.
- Git installed to manage the repository.

## GitOps Workflow Overview

1. **Make Changes to the Code**:
   - Push updates to the `main` branch of the Git repository.
   
2. **Automated Build and Push**:
   - GitHub Actions triggers a workflow that:
     - Builds a new Docker image.
     - Tags the image (e.g., `latest`).
     - Pushes the updated image to Docker Hub.

3. **Update Local or Production Environment**:
   - Pull the updated image from Docker Hub.
   - Restart the container to reflect the changes.

## Instructions to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/klever1995/gitops.git

2. **Pull the Latest Docker Image:**:

   Pull the most recent image from Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker pull ksrobalino/gitops:latest

3. **Pull the Latest Docker Image:**:

   Start the application in a Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name gitops_example ksrobalino gitops:latest

4. **Access the Application:**:

   Open your web browser or use tools like Postman to navigate to:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:8080
   
## Instructions for Updating the Application

1. **Push Changes:**

   Commit and push updates to the main branch on GitHub.

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow:**

   The workflow automatically rebuilds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.

3. **Pull the Updated Image:**

   On your local machine or production server, run:
   ```bash
   docker pull ksrobalino/gitops:latest

4. **Restart the Container:**

   Stop and remove the current container:
   ```bash
   docker rm -f gitops_example
   ```
    
   Start a new container with the updated image:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name gitops_example ksrobalino/gitops:latest

## Additional Notes

- This project is designed to highlight the simplicity and efficiency of GitOps.
- You can further automate deployments using tools like FluxCD or ArgoCD for production-grade environments.
- Ensure that sensitive data (e.g., secrets or API keys) is managed securely, possibly with tools like Docker Secrets or environment variables.
